Paraponera lets you create custom Ettercap Filters for MiTM attacks by Spoofing your targets.
If you wish to create your own custom filters please read first the examples of Ettercap (/usr/share/ettercap/etter.filter.examples).
I tried to make this as simple as possible.

All filter must start with # Author, Description and most important Type “tags” in the header of the file and end with || .

Example of header:

# Author: Bl4ck5w4n ||
# Description: This is a sample header of a filter
# Example of break line in the description and how to add links <a href=”http://bl4ck5w4n.blogspot.com”>http://bl4ck5w4n.blogspot.com</a>||
# Type: Single ||


Followed by (accept enconding):

if (ip.proto == TCP && tcp.dst == 80) {

   if (search(DATA.data, "Accept-Encoding")) {

      replace("Accept-Encoding", "Accept-Rubbish!"); 

   }

}



What is Type?

The Type could be None, Single or Multiple depending on what you wish to do.
For instance if you wish to replace an image you use Single because you're only going to change one string:

replace("img src=", "img src=\"REPLACE_ME\" ");
   

If you wish to change two string like replace one word for another then you Multiple:

replace("REPLACE_ME", "WITH_ME");


None:
Is used when you don't need to replace anything (ex: log traffic, drop connection) 

REPLACE_ME and WITH_ME:

You have to define the place were Paraponera so that it knows where to substitute strings and for the Single you will only need the REPLACE_ME and of course for the Multiple use REPLACE_ME and WITH_ME.

IMPORTANT Note: All caps lock matter




And thats it, see the filters that are already made for example.
